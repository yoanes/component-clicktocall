==== Version 2.1.0 (tag: clicktocall_v2_1_0) ====

Merged changes between 2.0.2.7 and 2.0.2.7.2 from branch_clicktocall_v2_0_2_7 onto the HEAD. See the release notes
for the relevant versions below. 

==== Version 2.0.2.8 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_2_8) ====

Default environment property files are no longer shipped with the component. This is due to the Mobiles team restructure.
There is no longer anything common between the environments of each app and hence the components can no longer predict 
sensible defaults.

Upgrade steps:
1. _Before you upgrade_, take the version prior to this and extract all property files that match the following pattern
    from the component's jar file:

    au/com/sensis/mobile/web/component/clicktocall/clicktocall-environment.properties.<platform>
    
2. Place these property files in your project source tree somewhere.

3. Change your build scripts to ensure that these property files result in clicktocall-environment.properties being in the
   root of your classpath at deployment time. For example:
   
   a) when building the deployment unit for dev, clicktocall-environment.properties.dev should be copied to 
      clicktocall-environment.properties in the root of the deployed app's classpath.
   b) when building the deployment unit for prd, clicktocall-environment.properties.prd should be copied to 
      clicktocall-environment.properties in the root of the deployed app's classpath.
      
4. Now you can upgrade your dependency and pull in the new version of this component.

5. For future upgrades, note that the following file in the jar is provided as a template for you to check what properties
   should be specified by your app.

    au/com/sensis/mobile/web/component/clicktocall/clicktocall-environment-template.properties

==== Version 2.0.2.7.2 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_2_7_2, branch: branch_clicktocall_v2_0_2_7) ====

Fixes so that the click to call component can be used in HTML snippets returned from AJAX responses.
Note that the AJAX HTML snippets will contain <script></script> nodes. You need to use a JavaScript framework that is
capable of parsing these. In the case of Mootools, if you use the Request.HTML object to issue the AJAX request, setting
the "append" or "update" options will ensure that Mootools handles the scripts in the response correctly.

Upgrade notes:
* API breaking changes to clicktocall:phoneOrFax JSP tag:
    * allowIphoneAppScraping optional attribute has been removed. 
    * now requires wrapperId attribute: 
        * Since this is an HTML id, you need to ensure that it is unique on your page. If your page is gradually built up
          via multiple AJAX requests, you might consider the Java UUID class for generating universally unique ids.  
        * If you used to pass in allowIphoneAppScraping (which is now illegal) as true, then you should set wrapperId to "phoneNumber" 
          for compatibility with your iphone client app which historically performed screen scraping.
        * If you set allowIphoneAppScrapingWpm to true, then you should set wrapperId to "phoneNumberWpm" 
          for compatibility with your iphone client app which historically performed screen scraping. The tag will also
          wrap the phoneNumber in a span and set the id to 'phoneNumber'.
    * Fax numbers were incorrectly given a fixed, hard coded id of 'faxNumber'. This has been fixed to use the value of the passed in 
      wrapperId attribute.
    * Fixed phoneOrFax.tag from the previous version so that it doesn't output JavaScript for devices not targeted to receive seamless click to call.

==== Version 2.0.2.7.1 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_2_7_1, branch: branch_clicktocall_v2_0_2_7) ====

Adding of JavaScript event handler to phone number links is now performed in the phoneOrFax.tag instead of in the setup tag.
We no longer have the Volantis restriction of all JavaScript having to reside in the document head.

==== Version 2.0.2.7 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_2_7) ====

Move the crf group of image category down the stack. 

==== Version 2.0.2.6 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_2_6) ====

All JSPs and JSP tag files now set trimDirectiveWhitespaces="true".

==== Version 2.0.2.5 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_2_5) ====
* HD800 callIcon updated with transparent background

==== Version 2.0.2.4 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_2_4) ====
* Update component with new icons
* Merge the HD1024 with HD800, and HD480 with L

==== Version 2.0.2.3 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_2_3) ====

Fixed tag files so that they do not attempt to reference ${context.device} which someone
clearly copied and pasted from showcase code.

==== Version 2.0.2.2 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_2_2) ====

Jiras:
* CUI-326 Clicktocall - No reporting event observed in logs
    * phoneOrFax.tag now ensures that whitespaces are stripped from markup. In particular,
      the URL passed into the tag is trimmed. 

==== Version 2.0.2.1 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_2_1) ====

Jiras:
* CUI-325: Maps for Intermediate devices-  Controls on the map lock 
    * Updated click to call component to use <dependency org="com.sensis" name="wl-core-component" rev="2.0.5" conf="default,test"/>
      as well to make sure that the change made for map will not break the click to call component.

==== Version 2.0.2 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_2) ====

Now depends on:
    <dependency org="com.sensis" name="wl-build-scripts" rev="2.0.9" conf="buildBootstrap->default" />
    <dependency org="com.sensis" name="wl-crf" rev="0.1.2-103" conf="default" />
    <dependency org="com.sensis" name="wl-core-component" rev="2.0.4" conf="default,test"/>
    <dependency org="com.sensis" name="wl-webapp-testbed" rev="2.0.6" conf="showcase->default"/>                                        

==== Version 2.0.1.1 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_1_1) ====

Jiras:

==== Version 2.0.1 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_1) ====

Closing off iteration 2.0.1 of component migration to the Content Rendering Framework. Jiras:
* [CUI-289] Clicktocall - Content Rendering Framework migration - Java 
* [CUI-296] Clicktocall - Content Rendering Framework migration - UI

==== Version 2.0.0-001 (tag: clicktocall_v2_0_0-001) ====

Jiras:
- CUI-289: Clicktocall - Content Rendering Framework migration - Java
    - ready for UI migration. JS migration already performed but not tested on handsets. 
      An important aspect of the tag file migration is that setup.tag 
      includes /WEB-INF/view/jsp/comp/clicktocall/setup.crf so that setup.crf is resolved 
      through the contentRenderingFramework.

Fixed:
- CUI-120: ClicktoCall Testpage -> Immediate Click To Call is not working as expected on Blackberry bold phone
    - JavaScript modified to ensure that the "+" character is not URI encoded, since this violates the
      the WTAI spec (WAP-188-WAPGenFormats) and tel specs (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2806.txt).
      Also see "2.2. Reserved Characters" at http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2396.html 
- CUI-171: JavaScript Serving - possible caching issue
    - Now depends on wl-build-scripts 1.0.10 and wl-core-component 1.0.28.
    - All mscr files include the @project.version.complete@ token
      in JavaScript file names.
    - Removed redundant properties from core-environment.properties.sandpit-test.
- CUI-195: ClickToCall: broken in iPhone Client app
    - Fixed reporting for the case when allowIphoneAppScraping attribute on the phoneOrFax tag is set to true.
      clickToCall.js now indexes the urls and phoneNumbers objects (formally arrays) by div id rather than numerical 
      index.
      
Other changes:
- CallAction now logs the URL and query string params that the action was invoked via.

Upgrade notes:
- Now depends on wl-build-scripts 1.0.10 and wl-core-component 1.0.27.
      
==== Version 1.1.4-001 (tag: clicktocall_v1_1_4-001) ====

Fixed:
- CUI-195: ClickToCall: broken in iPhone Client app
    - phoneOrFax tag now accepts optional allowIphoneAppScraping attribute. If true,
      the phone number div will be given an id of "phoneNumber". eg. of markup generated 
      when the flag is true (captured from the showcase - note that bug CUI-120 probably
      implies that the "tel:%2B" will be "tel:+" later:
    
        <div id="phoneNumber">
            <a href="tel:%2B61570010002" class="b"><img width="22" height="22" 
                src="http://localhost:8080/common-imageserver/images/component/clicktocall/call_L_22x22.gif" alt=""> (02) 7001 0002</a>
        </div>

      This seems consistent with the markup produced in current YellowMobile production:
               
        <div id="phoneNumber" class="m">
            <a href="../businessdetail/prepCall.do?bdMap=true&amp;bdRsId=&amp;lId=12813023&amp;suburb=Melbourne&amp;state=VIC&amp;lat=-37.8133895&amp;lon=144.9628322&amp;clickedFrom=bdp&amp;isExternal=false&amp;pn=%2803%29%208600%201600&amp;productId=451067654&amp;backToListingUrl=%2Fbrowse%2FbrowseListings.do%3Fkw%3D%26headingId%3D23051%26headingName%3DDentists%26suburb%3DMelbourne%26state%3DVIC%26lat%3D-37.8133895%26lon%3D144.9628322" class="l">
            <img width="22" height="22" src="/imageserver/common/images/icons/call_L_22x22.gif" class="k" alt="Call"> (03) 8600 1600</a>
        </div>
        
    - JavaScript in setup tag will additionally look for a div with id of "phoneNumber".
    - showcase updated with an extra phone number with label of "IPhone client scrapable: "
      that demonstrates usage of the phoneOrFax tag with allowIphoneAppScraping set to true.

==== Version 1.0.4 (tag: clicktocall_v1_0_4) ====

Now depends on wl-build-scripts 1.0.9 and wl-core-component 1.0.17 which collectively
fix hotswapping of JavaScript to a showcase that has been deployed using
the showcase*jar-expanded targets.

==== Version 1.0.3 (tag: clicktocall_v1_0_3) ====

Now depends on wl-core-component 1.0.16. CallAction now uses the new XmlHttpRequestDetector
