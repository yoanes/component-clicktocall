Fixed:
- CUI-120: ClicktoCall Testpage -> Immediate Click To Call is not working as expected on Blackberry bold phone
    - JavaScript modified to ensure that the "+" character is not URI encoded, since this violates the
      the WTAI spec (WAP-188-WAPGenFormats) and tel specs (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2806.txt).
      Also see "2.2. Reserved Characters" at http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2396.html 
- CUI-171: JavaScript Serving - possible caching issue
    - Now depends on wl-build-scripts 1.0.10 and wl-core-component 1.0.28.
    - All mscr files include the @project.version.complete@ token
      in JavaScript file names.

- CUI-195: ClickToCall: broken in iPhone Client app
    - Fixed reporting for the case when allowIphoneAppScraping attribute on the phoneOrFax tag is set to true.
      clickToCall.js now indexes the urls and phoneNumbers objects (formally arrays) by div id rather than numerical 
      index.
      
Other changes:
- CallAction now logs the URL and query string params that the action was invoked via.

Upgrade notes:
- Now depends on wl-build-scripts 1.0.10 and wl-core-component 1.0.27.
      
==== Version 1.1.4-001 (tag: clicktocall_v1_1_4-001) ====

Fixed:
- CUI-195: ClickToCall: broken in iPhone Client app
    - phoneOrFax tag now accepts optional allowIphoneAppScraping attribute. If true,
      the phone number div will be given an id of "phoneNumber". eg. of markup generated 
      when the flag is true (captured from the showcase - note that bug CUI-120 probably
      implies that the "tel:%2B" will be "tel:+" later:
    
        <div id="phoneNumber">
            <a href="tel:%2B61570010002" class="b"><img width="22" height="22" 
                src="http://localhost:8080/common-imageserver/images/component/clicktocall/call_L_22x22.gif" alt=""> (02) 7001 0002</a>
        </div>

      This seems consistent with the markup produced in current YellowMobile production:
               
        <div id="phoneNumber" class="m">
            <a href="../businessdetail/prepCall.do?bdMap=true&amp;bdRsId=&amp;lId=12813023&amp;suburb=Melbourne&amp;state=VIC&amp;lat=-37.8133895&amp;lon=144.9628322&amp;clickedFrom=bdp&amp;isExternal=false&amp;pn=%2803%29%208600%201600&amp;productId=451067654&amp;backToListingUrl=%2Fbrowse%2FbrowseListings.do%3Fkw%3D%26headingId%3D23051%26headingName%3DDentists%26suburb%3DMelbourne%26state%3DVIC%26lat%3D-37.8133895%26lon%3D144.9628322" class="l">
            <img width="22" height="22" src="/imageserver/common/images/icons/call_L_22x22.gif" class="k" alt="Call"> (03) 8600 1600</a>
        </div>
        
    - JavaScript in setup tag will additionally look for a div with id of "phoneNumber".
    - showcase updated with an extra phone number with label of "IPhone client scrapable: "
      that demonstrates usage of the phoneOrFax tag with allowIphoneAppScraping set to true.

==== Version 1.0.4 (tag: clicktocall_v1_0_4) ====

the showcase*jar-expanded targets.
